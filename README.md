# BeyondMD Interview Assessment

## Topic

- Make a simple page using HTML, CSS, and/or javascript that displays “Hello BeyondMD!“, and then dockerize it. It must run using docker compose.
- Write a script that collects and reports various system health information, such as CPU, memory, disk usage, active users, and/or running processes for a debian server.
- Create an idempotent Ansible playbook that automates the installation and configuration of Docker on a Debian bookworm host, ensuring it correctly handles repeated executions without unnecessary changes to the system state. Bonus points if you use vagrant as a local testing environment for your ansible playbook. I personally really like the "debian-sandbox/bookworm64" vagrant image.
